# No-Show Appointments Analysis Project
## by (Hadeer Ismail Gado)


## Introduction
>Our goal is to determine what factors are important for us to know, in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment or not. Our dataset contains 100k medical appointments in Brazil. it focuses on whether or not patients will show up on their scheduled appointments. Each row contains number of characteristics about the patient:
  >'ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
  >‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
  >‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
  >'No-show' it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up
  >Gender, Age.


## Project Walkthrough

> Data wrangling, which consists of:
  >Upload data
  >Assessing data ( Explore Quality & Tidiness issues)
  >Cleaning data

>Storing wrangled data
>Analyzing, and Visualizing data (Exploratory Analysis)

## Research Questions
>Does Gender affect no-show appointment?
>Does Interval day affect number of Absence?


## Installed Packages
  >pandas
  >NumPy
  >Matplotlib
  >Seaborn

## Conclusion
>In this dataset, we present no-show medical appointment. Number of females appointment are greater than males appointment (Number of Females is nearly twice the number of males), therefor Females reservation are twice the number of males reservations and Also absence in females are twice the number of absence in males, based on reservation number. 20% no-show appointments and 80% appointments presence. This number was analyzed after cleaning data for missing and incorrect values. Maximum number of males appointment are made for age between 0-10 years old. Minimum number of females appointment are made for age between 90-100 years old.
